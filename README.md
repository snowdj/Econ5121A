## This Year

This year (Academic year 2017-2018) I plan to refresh my teaching content.
Even if I update my lecture notes, they are not intended for class use.


## Old Lecture Notes

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project.
The text is very incomplete, and must contain many errors.
**Use them at your own risk!**

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull request.
