# ECON5121A: Econometric Theory and Applications

“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”
---Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: *Faust: Part I*

### Year 2018

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

I have substantially updated my lecture notes this year to bring forward the teaching of R and demonstrate its use along with theory.

* [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ5121A/tree/master/lec_notes_ipynb)

**Caveat**: This is an ongoing writing project.
The text is incomplete, and must contain errors.
*Use them at your own risk!*
I edit the IPython notebooks (\*.ipynb) as the latest version. The PDF version may be behind, though it is print friendly.

I encourage anyone, in particular students taking my class, to contribute or improve the notes. Send me pull requests.

**Important dates**: Midterm Oct 19. Final: Dec 7.
