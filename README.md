# ECON5121A: Econometric Theory and Applications

“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”
---Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: *Faust: Part I*

### Year 2019

My lectures are based primarily on [Bruce Hansen's textbook](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/).

I have substantially updated my lecture notes this year to bring forward the teaching of R and demonstrate its use along with theory.
