# Jupyter Server

The `*.ipynb` files are the Ipython notebooks. They can be opened in two ways:

1. Install Anaconda and R kernel on a local computer

or

2. Click the AWS server [https://ec2-52-73-114-9.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8888](https://ec2-52-73-114-9.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8888) and log in with a password.

The first option runs the notebooks locally, while the second option execute the files on the Amazon Web Server cloud.
